# Javascript reosurces

Javascript is the most widely used language powering the 
majority web. Here are resources to learn Javascript.

# Basics of Javascript (the syntax part)

Below is the link for the Mozilla's Javascript documentation
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript.

This web resource consists of detailed guide and references
for learning javascript or using it parallely during 
development process.

Once you have learned JS syntax, you can start using it 
in browser to make HTML and CSS interactive.

Now that you understand HTML and CSS and the syntax of JS,
you will need to use the Javascript in the browser. Below 
documentation reference from Mozilla provides information 
about the APIs that can be used to make your website 
interactive

This marks the concepts required for basic javascript 
concepts required for frontend.

To learn advanced and modern concepts you will need to 
understand part of backend. 

# Understanding what npm does.
If you are reluctant to get into backend (atleast not yet),
one main concept you will need to learn is `npm`.

For those who only worked on python, may have heard of `pip`
used for downloading modules developed and maintained by 
someone so that we dont need to code it manually.

`npm` is basically pip for javascript. It is a package 
manager which helps us to use and develop chunks of 
code (package or modules). 

So for those who havent worked on anything other than Clang,
think of this scenario. You want to use a piece of code 
which your friend has developed. What are the ways you can 
use it? 

You can ask your friend to share his code through 
mail or gdrive. But downloading the code and storing it in 
your system takes some steps.

To eliminate these steps, there is a tool(command) that 
allows your friend to package his code, update it in a 
central location (instead of gmail or drive). Now you tell 
the tool to download the certain package your friend has 
developed with only one step and you can start using the 
package in your code with some importing mechanism the 
language provides.

# Starting Backend in Javascript

Starting with Backend, the best place is to start with 
node.js You may want to ask what this new node.js is, is it
a new package.

Node js is not a package but an environment to run JS on a
system/server instead of browser. So what is this 
environment. This is a bit different than what you have seen
with other languages. Javascript when built was only 
intended for the browser. So it didnt have many common 
packages like IO(Input Output) and File System. So node.js 
forked the google's opensource javascript engine called V8 
and implemented the packages required for language and hence
called environment.

There are other new environments like `deno` (created by 
same person who created node.js) and `bun` (created this 
year itself) but node.js is the environment supported by 
community and there is no need to focus on the other 
environments unless you are an enthusiast.

official Node.js docs - https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/

Node.js docs may feel intimidating if you are very new to 
programming. But luckily there are a lot of community 
members who posted video tutorials which I recommend if you
are a beginner

Since node is basically javascript, it can be quickly learned.
The above playlist also explained about express.js and MVC 
architecture to build backend.
