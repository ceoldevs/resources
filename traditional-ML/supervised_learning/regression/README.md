# Traditional Machine Learning

## Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, training involves labelled data.
### Regression
Given a set of independent variables/features, the output/dependent variable must be predicted. The dependent variables are continuous in nature.
- **Simple Linear Regression** : In this type of regression, there is only one feature for which outcome has to be predicted. Such cases won't be seen in real world but nevertheless it is important to get started with it.

- **Multiple Linear Regression** : Here, there are more than one independent variables whose outcome has to be predicted.

- **Polynomial Regression** : The dependent variable is predicted based on a polynomial in *x* (dependent variable) of degreen *'n'*.

- **Support Vector Regression** : Support Vector Machines (SVM) support linear and non-linear regression that we refer to as SVR (Support Vector Regression). SVR performs linear regression in a higher dimensional space with the help of a kernel fucntion.

- **Decision Tree Regression** : Part of CART (Classification And Regression Trees)

- **Random Forest Regression** : It combines multiple decision trees to obtain the output. Hence why it is part of Ensemble Learning (using multiple algorithms or a single one multiple times) algorithms.
