# Web development

## Frontend

If you havent learned HTML and CSS by this point, you can 
use the w3schools material which can be finished in 
around 2-3hrs.

HTML - https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp
CSS - https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp

Before going deep into web development, one should understand 
what HTTP (the underlying networking concept used to share information between a remote computer and your client).

For frontend, currently javascript (or typescript) is the 
language used widely in the web. 

> A new concept of webassembly is emerging which is 
allowing to run any language in the browser. Information 
related to web assembly will be updated later as it is a
concept not used much unless there is a certain specific 
requirement.

Learn javascript by looking at the resources put up in the 
same repository at [Javascript](../javascript/README.md)

## Backend

Learning backend is a bit more different than frontend 
because you have different languages where you can build
the webservers and connect to different databases which 
store your state of application.

Depending on the language the resources will change but 
there are some standards followed in all languages. The 
language agnostic concept resources are listed in below 
sections.

### Rest API

You may have heard the term API by now. If not, API 
(Application Programming Interface) is basically a concept
which allows us to communicate between frontend and backend.

**Using Postman**

Postman allows us to test our backend APIs without having a
frontend making queries and instead this software mimics the
work of frontend application.

If you think postman is too roboust to work with, linux 
has a utility which can be used to work with called cURL
